      "<p class=\"text-justify\">Kinetics FDS spring mounts are recommended for use in isolating floor mounted sources of noise and vibration located near critically quiet areas.</p>
        <p class=\"text-justify\">FDS spring mounts are typically used to reduce the transmission of noise and vibration from low speed mechanical equipment into a building structure. Operating static deflections are available to 4\" (102 mm) to compensate for long span floor structures.</p>
        <p class=\"text-justify\">FDS spring mounts are used in a wide range of applications, some requiring Kinetics equipment bases in addition to spring isolators, and can be used to support and isolate the following equipment types: reciprocating air or refrigeration compressors, close coupled and base mounted pumps, packaged air handling and refrigeration equipment, centrifugal fans, internal combustion engines, and similar equipment. Kinetics FDS Isolators are for use on equipment that is not subject to lateral forces such as wind.</p>",
